    <h1>Slice() Method</h1>
    <p>Copy elements of an array.
        The slice() method returns a shallow copy of a portion of an array into a new array object selected from start to end (end not included) where start and end represent the index of items in that array. The original array will not be modified.
        The slice() method is a copying method. It does not alter this but instead returns a shallow copy that contains some of the same elements as the ones from the original array.
        
        The slice() method preserves empty slots. If the sliced portion is sparse, the returned array is sparse as well.
        
        The slice() method is generic. It only expects the this value to have a length property and integer-keyed properties.
        The String.prototype.slice() method extracts a portion of a string and returns it as a substring. The following shows the syntax of the slice() method:
        </p>
        <span>Syntex: Array.slice(start, end)
            The slice() method has two optional parameters start and end.
